## 1. Description
  
* it is used when a class needs to sends his update state to other classes
* it can be  thought as the newspaper/magazine subscription process


## 2. Design Principles
* Identify the aspects that vary and separate them from what stays the same.
* Program to an interface, not an implementation
* Favor composition over inheritance
